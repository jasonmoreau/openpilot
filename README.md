This is my personal openpilot repo, geared towards my own car and configuration:
* 2018 Toyota RAV4 XLE (ICE/non-hybrid)
* Comma Pedal
* SmartDSU

Branches:

  * Based on pure/stock openpilot
  * Allows you to toggle openpilot ACC/longitudinal control on and off from the UI
* [argonaut-0.8.8](https://github.com/jasonmoreau/openpilot/tree/argonaut-0.8.8)
  * Based on Aragon's [0.8.8-shane-spektor-honda-toyota](https://github.com/Aragon7777/openpilot/tree/0.8.8-shane-spektor-honda-toyota) fork
  * Includes toggle from [op-long-toggle](https://github.com/jasonmoreau/openpilot/tree/op-long-toggle)
  * Added cruise_offset parameter to op_edit for adjusting set cruise speed muiltiplier
