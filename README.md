This is my personal openpilot repo, geared towards my own car and configuration:
* 2018 Toyota RAV4 XLE (ICE/non-hybrid)
* Comma Pedal
* SmartDSU

Branches:
* [op-long-toggle](https://github.com/jasonmoreau/openpilot/tree/op-long-toggle)
  * Based on pure/stock openpilot
  * Allows you to toggle openpilot ACC/longitudinal control on and off from the UI

Check out [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/J4SONM/videos) to see what I'm up to with openpilot and my RAV4!

Also, feel free to message me on Discord at [jasonmoreau#3991](https://discordapp.com/users/428354577960665090) if you have any questions.
